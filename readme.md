####Behind the Scenes
This app was an idea for a long time before it finally came to fruition. It is written in PHP using the [Laravel Framework](http://laravel.com). Data is represented using the [arborjs](http://arborjs.org) visualization library.

Throughout the development process, I became more familiar with an MVC framework, authentication, and a host of JavaScript concepts. Also, I made extensive use of the one-to-many and many-to-many relationships in Laravel’s Eloquent ORM to represent the complex connections between a graph’s categories, verbs, and nouns.

On the client side, I made AJAX requests to the server to add nodes and request users’ graphs. Reading graph data required PHP objects to be converted to JSON so that arborjs could display them. I also used the [Google Charts API](https://developers.google.com/chart/) to compile statistics on users’ graphs.
